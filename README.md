# Flow Field Particle Animation

<img src="./images/flow-field.gif">

This project showcases a captivating particle animation created using HTML5 Canvas. The animation features particles that move in response to a generated flow field, resulting in an entrancing visual experience.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
3. Watch the mesmerizing flow field particle animation unfold before your eyes.

## Overview

The animation is driven by JavaScript code that employs the HTML5 Canvas element to render the visual effects. The code is organized into two main classes:

### Particle Class

The `Particle` class represents individual particles within the animation. Each particle possesses attributes such as position, speed, history, color, and more. The class defines methods to draw and update particles based on the flow field.

### Effect Class

The `Effect` class manages the overall animation. It handles the initialization of the flow field, the creation of particles, and the rendering process. Additionally, it provides methods for resizing the canvas and drawing optional grid lines for debugging purposes.

## Customization

The animation is highly customizable, allowing you to achieve various visual effects. Modify parameters such as canvas size, particle count, cell size, and more within the code to create unique animations.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Observe the captivating flow field particle animation.
3. Toggle grid lines for debugging by pressing the 'd' key.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the world of creative coding and generative art, showcasing the potential of Vanilla JavaScript and canvas-based animations.
